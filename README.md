Automatically reads the BookWorm Deluxe screen using OCR (a bit inconsistent) and proceeds to choose the highest point word via mouse inputs.

This prorgam is written in Java Processing, meaning you will require the Processing IDE to run this program (https://processing.org/download). You will also require the BookWorm Deluxe game, this can be found on the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/details/BookwormDeluxe_201901).
